### Technical Details

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Source separation now properly conditions weather effects on weather embeddings
- **CNN Encoders**: Replaced simple MLPs with 1D CNNs for better temporal modeling

#### Loss Function Implementation
- **MINE Loss**: Neural estimation of mutual information I(z_base; z_weather)
- **Adversarial Loss**: GAN-style training for independence enforcement
- **Distance Correlation**: Statistical dependence minimization
- **Weighted Combination**: Proper balancing of all loss components

#### Training Strategy
- **Stage 1**: CSSAE pre-training with reconstruction + causal losses
- **Stage 2**: Joint optimization with clustering objective
- **Optimization**: Separate optimizers for main model and discriminator
- **Convergence**: Early stopping and validation monitoring

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
