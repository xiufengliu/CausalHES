\begin{abstract}
Household energy segmentation, the task of clustering consumers based on their electricity consumption patterns, is fundamental to smart grid management and energy policy design. However, conventional clustering approaches operate on mixed energy signals that confound intrinsic household consumption behaviors with external weather influences, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. To address this challenge, we introduce CausalHES (Causally-Inspired Household Energy Segmentation), a novel deep learning framework that leverages causal inference principles to separate household energy consumption into weather-independent base patterns and weather-influenced effects. The core innovation is the Causal Source Separation Autoencoder (CSSAE), which decomposes observed load signals $L(t) = S_{\text{base}}(t) + S_{\text{weather}}(t) + \epsilon(t)$ while enforcing statistical independence between base load and weather representations through a composite objective combining mutual information minimization, adversarial training, and distance correlation constraints. Clustering is then performed on the causally-separated base load embeddings using Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), ensuring that household segmentation reflects intrinsic consumption behaviors rather than weather-driven variations. Extensive experiments on a realistic synthetic dataset modeled after Pecan Street characteristics demonstrate that CausalHES achieves 99.2\% clustering accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (95.8\%), deep learning approaches (97.6\%), and multi-modal baselines (98.1\%). Beyond superior clustering performance, CausalHES provides interpretable source separation results with low reconstruction error (MSE = 0.0023) and high statistical independence (score = 0.892), enabling actionable insights into the causal structure of household energy consumption patterns. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for energy analytics that explicitly accounts for causal relationships in multi-modal time series clustering.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{H}{ousehold} energy segmentation, the task of grouping consumers based on their electricity consumption patterns, has emerged as a cornerstone of modern smart grid management and energy policy design \cite{smart_grid_review}. By identifying distinct behavioral archetypes, utility providers can develop targeted demand response programs, optimize load forecasting, improve grid stability, and design more effective energy efficiency initiatives \cite{demand_response_survey}. However, the escalating complexity and volume of smart meter data, compounded by the necessity to account for external influential factors, pose significant challenges that traditional clustering algorithms are often ill-equipped to handle.

Early approaches to this problem predominantly relied on traditional clustering methods such as K-means \cite{kmeans_clustering} and spectral clustering \cite{spectral_clustering}, typically applied to handcrafted features derived from load profiles. While offering initial insights, these methods frequently fail to capture the intricate, non-linear temporal dependencies inherent in energy consumption data. The advent of deep learning has ushered in more potent representation learning techniques for clustering. Seminal works like Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) \cite{deep_embedding_clustering_xie} demonstrated the efficacy of jointly learning feature representations and cluster assignments. Nevertheless, such models are typically designed for uni-modal data, thereby disregarding crucial external factors—most notably meteorological conditions—which are widely acknowledged as primary drivers of energy consumption.

The integration of multi-modal data, such as energy load shapes and corresponding weather time series, introduces a new stratum of complexity. These modalities are inherently heterogeneous, possessing disparate scales, statistical properties, and temporal dynamics. A critical challenge lies in fusing this information in a manner that is both meaningful and adaptive. For instance, the influence of ambient temperature on electricity usage is not static but varies significantly depending on the time of day, season, and the household's intrinsic consumption patterns. Moreover, for a clustering framework to be deployable in critical infrastructure applications, it must furnish not only cluster labels but also a principled measure of its own predictive uncertainty. Finally, for the derived insights to be actionable, the model should be interpretable, offering explanations of how external factors shape different consumption behaviors.

To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces CausalHES (Causally-Inspired Household Energy Segmentation), a novel deep learning framework that revolutionizes household energy clustering by leveraging causal inference principles. Rather than directly clustering mixed energy signals that confound intrinsic consumption behaviors with weather effects, CausalHES reformulates the problem as a causal source separation task followed by clustering on causally-independent base load patterns. The framework is built upon the key insight that observed household energy consumption can be decomposed as $L(t) = S_{\text{base}}(t) + S_{\text{weather}}(t) + \epsilon(t)$, where meaningful household segmentation should be based on the weather-independent base patterns $S_{\text{base}}(t)$ rather than the confounded mixed signal $L(t)$. CausalHES achieves this through two core innovations: (1) a Causal Source Separation Autoencoder (CSSAE) that learns to decompose energy consumption into causally-independent components while enforcing statistical independence through multiple constraints including mutual information minimization, adversarial training, and distance correlation; and (2) Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) applied to the separated base load embeddings to identify intrinsic household consumption archetypes. Extensive experiments on realistic synthetic data demonstrate that CausalHES achieves 99.2\% clustering accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (95.8\%), deep learning approaches (97.6\%), and multi-modal baselines (98.1\%). Beyond superior clustering performance, CausalHES provides interpretable source separation results that offer actionable insights into the causal structure of household energy consumption patterns.

The main contributions of this work are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We propose CausalHES, a novel deep learning framework that reformulates household energy clustering as a causal source separation problem, enabling the discovery of weather-independent consumption patterns that reflect intrinsic household behaviors.
    \item We introduce the Causal Source Separation Autoencoder (CSSAE), which decomposes observed energy consumption into causally-independent base load and weather effect components while enforcing statistical independence through a composite objective combining mutual information minimization, adversarial training, and distance correlation.
    \item We demonstrate that clustering on causally-separated base load embeddings using Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) significantly outperforms conventional approaches that operate on mixed energy signals, achieving 99.2\% accuracy compared to 98.1\% for the best multi-modal baseline.
    \item We provide comprehensive experimental validation including ablation studies that confirm the necessity of each component, source separation quality analysis, and comparison with traditional, deep learning, and multi-modal clustering methods.
    \item We establish a new paradigm for energy analytics that explicitly accounts for causal relationships in multi-modal time series, providing both superior clustering performance and interpretable insights into the causal structure of household energy consumption.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews related work in deep clustering, causal inference, source separation, and multi-modal learning. Section III details the proposed CausalHES framework, elaborating on the CSSAE architecture, causal independence constraints, and clustering methodology. Section IV describes the experimental setup, dataset characteristics, and evaluation metrics. Section V presents comprehensive quantitative results, ablation studies, and source separation analysis. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and outlines directions for future research in causal-aware energy analytics.

\section{Related Work}
Our work is situated at the intersection of several key research areas: deep clustering, causal inference and source separation, multi-modal learning, and household energy analytics. We review pertinent literature in these domains and delineate how CausalHES synthesizes and extends existing research to address the fundamental challenge of weather-confounded energy consumption clustering.

\subsection{Deep Clustering}
Traditional clustering algorithms, such as K-means \cite{kmeans_clustering} and spectral clustering \cite{spectral_clustering}, operate on fixed, often manually engineered, feature representations. Consequently, their performance is heavily contingent upon the quality of these input features. Deep clustering has emerged to overcome this limitation by jointly learning feature representations and cluster assignments within a unified end-to-end framework.

Early deep clustering approaches often involved a sequential two-step process: first, an autoencoder (AE) or a variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the data \cite{autoencoder_representation_learning}; subsequently, a traditional clustering algorithm is applied to this learned embedding. A significant advancement was Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) \cite{deep_embedding_clustering_xie}, which introduced a clustering-oriented loss to simultaneously optimize the embeddings and refine cluster assignments using Student's t-distribution and KL divergence. This seminal work spurred a lineage of related methods focusing on alternative clustering loss functions, network architectures \cite{improved_dec}, or reformulations of the clustering problem.

However, a fundamental limitation of existing deep clustering methods is their assumption that the input data directly reflects the underlying cluster structure. In the context of household energy consumption, this assumption is violated because observed load profiles are confounded by external factors such as weather conditions. Our CausalHES framework addresses this limitation by performing clustering on causally-separated base load patterns rather than the mixed observed signals, ensuring that cluster assignments reflect intrinsic household behaviors rather than weather-driven variations.

\subsection{Causal Inference and Source Separation}
Causal inference aims to identify and quantify cause-and-effect relationships from observational data \cite{pearl2009causality}. In the context of household energy consumption, weather conditions represent a clear causal factor that influences electricity usage through mechanisms such as heating and cooling demands. However, conventional clustering approaches fail to account for this causal structure, leading to clusters that reflect weather-driven variations rather than intrinsic household behaviors.

Source separation, particularly Independent Component Analysis (ICA) \cite{hyvarinen2000independent}, provides a mathematical framework for decomposing mixed signals into statistically independent components. Traditional ICA methods assume linear mixing and require the number of sources to equal the number of observations. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled non-linear source separation through neural networks \cite{deep_ica_survey}, but these methods typically lack the causal constraints necessary for meaningful decomposition in energy consumption scenarios.

Our CausalHES framework bridges causal inference and source separation by explicitly modeling the causal relationship between weather and energy consumption. Unlike generic source separation methods, CSSAE enforces the causal constraint that base load patterns should be statistically independent of weather conditions, ensuring that the separated components have meaningful causal interpretations. This approach is inspired by recent work in causal representation learning \cite{causal_representation_learning} but specifically tailored for the energy domain.

\subsection{Multi-Modal Learning for Energy Analytics}
Multi-modal deep learning endeavors to construct models capable of processing and relating information from diverse data sources \cite{multi_modal_deep_learning_survey}. In the energy domain, researchers have explored various approaches to incorporate weather information into consumption analysis. Early fusion methods concatenate load and weather features before model input, while late fusion combines predictions from separate uni-modal models \cite{energy_forecasting_survey}.

However, existing multi-modal approaches for energy analytics suffer from a fundamental conceptual flaw: they treat weather and load data as equally important modalities to be fused, rather than recognizing the causal relationship where weather influences consumption but not vice versa. This leads to models that learn spurious correlations between weather patterns and consumption without properly separating the causal effects.

Recent work in energy consumption clustering has attempted to address weather confounding through various strategies. Some approaches use weather normalization as a preprocessing step \cite{weather_normalization_energy}, while others incorporate weather features as additional clustering dimensions \cite{multi_dimensional_energy_clustering}. However, these methods lack the principled causal framework necessary to ensure that clusters reflect intrinsic household behaviors rather than weather-driven variations. Our CausalHES framework addresses this gap by explicitly modeling the causal structure and performing source separation to isolate weather-independent consumption patterns.

\subsection{Statistical Independence and Deep Learning}
Enforcing statistical independence between learned representations is a fundamental challenge in deep learning. Traditional approaches include adversarial training \cite{adversarial_independence}, where a discriminator attempts to predict one representation from another while the encoder is trained to fool the discriminator. Mutual information minimization using neural estimators such as MINE \cite{belghazi2018mine} provides another approach to enforce independence. Distance correlation \cite{szekely2007measuring} offers a non-parametric measure of dependence that captures both linear and non-linear relationships.

Recent work has explored combining multiple independence measures for more robust constraint enforcement \cite{composite_independence_constraints}. However, these methods are typically applied in generic representation learning settings without consideration of domain-specific causal structures. Our CausalHES framework adapts these techniques specifically for the energy domain, where the independence constraint $Z_{\text{base}} \perp Z_{\text{weather}}$ has a clear causal interpretation: base load patterns should be independent of weather conditions by definition.

\subsection{Positioning Our Work}
CausalHES synthesizes and extends these distinct research threads to address a fundamental limitation in existing energy clustering approaches. Unlike traditional deep clustering methods that assume input data directly reflects cluster structure, CausalHES recognizes that observed energy consumption is confounded by weather effects and performs clustering on causally-separated base load patterns. In contrast to generic multi-modal fusion techniques, our CSSAE is specifically designed to enforce causal independence constraints that have meaningful domain interpretation. Furthermore, distinct from existing source separation methods that focus on signal reconstruction, CausalHES integrates source separation with clustering objectives to enable both accurate decomposition and meaningful household segmentation. By combining causal inference principles with deep learning architectures, CausalHES establishes a new paradigm for energy analytics that explicitly accounts for causal relationships in multi-modal time series clustering.

\section{Methodology: Causally-Inspired Household Energy Segmentation}

\subsection{Problem Formulation and Theoretical Foundation}

This paper introduces CausalHES (Causally-Inspired Household Energy Segmentation), a principled deep learning framework that addresses the fundamental challenge of household energy clustering by leveraging causal inference principles. We begin with a formal problem statement and theoretical analysis of identifiability conditions.

\subsubsection{Causal Model and Assumptions}

Let $\mathbf{W}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{D_w}$ denote weather variables and $\mathbf{L}(t) \in \mathbb{R}$ denote observed household energy consumption at time $t$. We assume the following structural causal model:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) &= f_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{U}_{\text{base}}(t)) \label{eq:base_generation}\\
\mathbf{S}_{\text{weather}}(t) &= f_{\text{weather}}(\mathbf{W}(t), \mathbf{U}_{\text{weather}}(t)) \label{eq:weather_generation}\\
\mathbf{L}(t) &= \mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) + \mathbf{S}_{\text{weather}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}(t) \label{eq:causal_decomposition}
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t)$ represents weather-independent base consumption patterns, $\mathbf{S}_{\text{weather}}(t)$ represents weather-influenced effects, $\mathbf{U}_{\text{base}}(t)$ and $\mathbf{U}_{\text{weather}}(t)$ are unobserved confounders, and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ is additive noise.

\textbf{Causal Assumptions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Causal Sufficiency:} Weather causally influences consumption but not vice versa: $\mathbf{W}(t) \rightarrow \mathbf{S}_{\text{weather}}(t) \rightarrow \mathbf{L}(t)$
    \item \textbf{Base Independence:} Base consumption is causally independent of weather: $\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) \perp \mathbf{W}(t)$
    \item \textbf{Temporal Stationarity:} The causal mechanisms $f_{\text{base}}$ and $f_{\text{weather}}$ are time-invariant
    \item \textbf{Additive Mixing:} Components combine linearly as in Eq. \ref{eq:causal_decomposition}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Identifiability Analysis}

A critical theoretical question is under what conditions the decomposition in Eq. \ref{eq:causal_decomposition} is identifiable from observations $(\mathbf{L}(t), \mathbf{W}(t))$.

\textbf{Theorem 1 (Identifiability Conditions):} Under the causal assumptions above, the decomposition $\mathbf{L}(t) = \mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) + \mathbf{S}_{\text{weather}}(t) + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}(t)$ is identifiable up to a constant shift if:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The weather effect function $f_{\text{weather}}$ is invertible in its first argument
    \item The base consumption $\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t)$ exhibits temporal structure (non-i.i.d.)
    \item Weather variables $\mathbf{W}(t)$ have sufficient variation to span the weather effect space
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Proof Sketch:} The identifiability follows from the causal independence constraint $\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) \perp \mathbf{W}(t)$ combined with the temporal structure assumption. Given weather observations, the weather effect component can be identified through the functional relationship $f_{\text{weather}}$, and the base component is recovered as the weather-independent residual. The temporal structure prevents trivial solutions where all variation is attributed to one component. $\square$

\subsubsection{Learning Objective and Theoretical Justification}

Let $\mathbf{x}_i^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times 1}$ denote the load time series and $\mathbf{x}_i^{(w)} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times D_w}$ denote the weather time series for the $i$-th household. CausalHES learns a mapping:

\begin{equation}
f_\theta: (\mathbf{x}^{(l)}, \mathbf{x}^{(w)}) \mapsto (\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather-effect}})
\label{eq:causal_mapping}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_b}$ represents the base load embedding, $\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_w}$ represents the weather embedding, and $\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather-effect}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{we}}$ represents the weather effect embedding.

The composite objective function is:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}} + \lambda_{\text{causal}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} + \lambda_{\text{cluster}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}}
\label{eq:total_loss_causal}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Theoretical Justification:} This objective implements a regularized empirical risk minimization framework where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}}$ ensures the learned representations preserve information content, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$ enforces the causal independence constraints from our theoretical model, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}}$ optimizes for downstream clustering performance. The regularization weights $\lambda_{\text{causal}}, \lambda_{\text{cluster}}$ control the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and causal structure learning.

\subsection{Causal Source Separation Autoencoder (CSSAE) Architecture}

The core innovation of CausalHES is the Causal Source Separation Autoencoder (CSSAE), which implements the theoretical causal model through a deep neural architecture. The CSSAE consists of four main components: (1) modality-specific encoders, (2) a theoretically-grounded source separation module, (3) dual decoders for component reconstruction, and (4) causal independence enforcement mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Modality-Specific Encoders}

\textbf{Load Encoder:} The load encoder $E_l: \mathbb{R}^{T \times 1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_m}$ processes the household load time series to extract a mixed latent representation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{z}_{\text{mixed}} = E_l(\mathbf{x}^{(l)}; \theta_l) = \text{Dense}(\text{GAP}(\text{Conv1D}^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)})))
\label{eq:load_encoder}
\end{equation}

where $\text{Conv1D}^{(3)}$ denotes a stack of three 1D dilated convolutional layers with dilation rates $r \in \{1, 2, 4\}$, kernel size 3, and exponentially increasing filter sizes $\{32, 64, 128\}$. Each layer includes batch normalization, ReLU activation, and dropout ($p=0.1$). $\text{GAP}$ denotes global average pooling, and $\text{Dense}$ is a fully connected layer projecting to dimension $d_m = 64$.

\textbf{Architectural Justification:} The dilated convolutions capture multi-scale temporal patterns essential for modeling diverse household consumption behaviors. The exponential dilation pattern ensures the receptive field covers the full 24-hour period while maintaining computational efficiency.

\textbf{Weather Encoder:} The weather encoder $E_w: \mathbb{R}^{T \times D_w} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_w}$ extracts weather-specific representations:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}} = E_w(\mathbf{x}^{(w)}; \theta_w) = \text{Dense}(\text{GAP}(\text{Conv1D}^{(2)}(\mathbf{x}^{(w)})))
\label{eq:weather_encoder}
\end{equation}

The weather encoder uses a simpler two-layer architecture with filter sizes $\{16, 32\}$, reflecting the lower complexity of weather patterns compared to load dynamics. The output dimension is $d_w = 32$.

\subsubsection{Theoretically-Grounded Source Separation Module}

The source separation module implements the causal decomposition from Eq. \ref{eq:causal_decomposition} through learnable functions that respect the theoretical constraints. We propose two architecturally distinct approaches with different theoretical properties:

\textbf{Residual Separation Strategy:} This approach directly implements the causal model by first predicting weather effects, then extracting base consumption as the weather-independent residual:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather-effect}} &= f_{\text{weather}}([\mathbf{z}_{\text{mixed}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}]; \theta_{we}) \label{eq:weather_effect}\\
\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}} &= f_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{z}_{\text{mixed}} - g(\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather-effect}}); \theta_b) \label{eq:base_extraction}
\end{align}

where $g(\cdot)$ is a learned projection ensuring dimensional compatibility. This approach enforces the constraint that base patterns are orthogonal to weather effects by construction.

\textbf{Multi-head Separation Strategy:} This approach learns both components simultaneously through separate prediction heads:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}} &= f_{\text{base}}(\mathbf{z}_{\text{mixed}}; \theta_b) \label{eq:multihead_base}\\
\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather-effect}} &= f_{\text{weather}}([\mathbf{z}_{\text{mixed}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}]; \theta_{we}) \label{eq:multihead_weather}
\end{align}

This approach relies on the causal independence loss to enforce separation, providing more flexibility but requiring stronger regularization.

\textbf{Theoretical Comparison:} The residual approach provides stronger inductive bias toward the causal model but may be sensitive to weather effect prediction errors. The multi-head approach is more flexible but requires careful regularization to avoid trivial solutions. We empirically compare both approaches in Section V.

\textbf{Implementation Details:} Both $f_{\text{base}}: \mathbb{R}^{d_m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_b}$ and $f_{\text{weather}}: \mathbb{R}^{d_m + d_w} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_{we}}$ are implemented as two-layer MLPs with ReLU activations and batch normalization. Output dimensions are $d_b = 32$ and $d_{we} = 16$, chosen to balance expressiveness with regularization.

\subsubsection{Dual Decoders}
The CSSAE employs separate decoders to reconstruct the base load and weather effect components, ensuring that the separation is meaningful and preserves the original signal structure:

\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\text{base}} &= D_b(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}; \theta_{db}) \label{eq:base_decoder}\\
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\text{weather}} &= D_w(\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather-effect}}; \theta_{dw}) \label{eq:weather_decoder}
\end{align}

The total reconstructed load is obtained by summing the decoded components:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(l)} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\text{base}} + \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\text{weather}}
\label{eq:total_reconstruction}
\end{equation}

Both decoders use transposed 1D convolutions to reconstruct the temporal structure, with adaptive pooling to match the target timesteps.

\subsection{Causal Independence Constraints: Theory and Implementation}

The fundamental principle of CausalHES is enforcing the causal independence constraint from our theoretical model. However, we must distinguish between causal independence ($\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) \perp \mathbf{W}(t)$) and the statistical independence we can enforce in the learned representation space ($\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}} \perp \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}$).

\subsubsection{Theoretical Justification for Statistical Independence}

\textbf{Proposition 1:} Under the causal model assumptions (Section III.A.1), if the encoders $E_l$ and $E_w$ are sufficiently expressive and the source separation is perfect, then enforcing $\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}} \perp \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}$ is equivalent to enforcing the causal independence $\mathbf{S}_{\text{base}}(t) \perp \mathbf{W}(t)$.

\textbf{Proof Sketch:} Since $\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}} = E_w(\mathbf{W}(t))$ and $\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}$ represents the base consumption component, statistical independence in the representation space implies independence of the underlying causal factors under perfect reconstruction. $\square$

In practice, we implement a composite causal loss that combines multiple independence measures to robustly enforce this constraint:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} = \lambda_{\text{MI}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{MI}} + \lambda_{\text{adv}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}} + \lambda_{\text{dcor}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{dcor}}
\label{eq:composite_causal_loss}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Theoretical Justification for Composite Loss:} Each component captures different aspects of dependence: MINE estimates mutual information (capturing all statistical dependencies), adversarial training enforces distributional independence, and distance correlation captures non-linear dependencies. The combination provides robust independence enforcement across different types of statistical relationships.

\subsubsection{Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE)}

We minimize the mutual information $I(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}; \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}})$ using the MINE estimator \cite{belghazi2018mine}:

\begin{equation}
\hat{I}_{\text{MINE}} = \sup_{T_\phi} \mathbb{E}_{P(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}})}[T_\phi(\mathbf{z}_b, \mathbf{z}_w)] - \log \mathbb{E}_{P(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}) \times P(\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}})}[e^{T_\phi(\mathbf{z}_b, \mathbf{z}_w)}]
\label{eq:mine_estimator}
\end{equation}

The MINE loss is: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{MI}} = \hat{I}_{\text{MINE}}$, where $T_\phi: \mathbb{R}^{d_b + d_w} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a neural network with parameters $\phi$. We implement $T_\phi$ as a 3-layer MLP with hidden dimensions $[64, 32, 1]$ and ELU activations.

\textbf{Implementation Details:} We use exponential moving averages for the log-sum-exp term to improve stability, and clip gradients to prevent exploding gradients during MINE optimization.

\subsubsection{Adversarial Independence Training}

We employ adversarial training where a discriminator $D_\psi: \mathbb{R}^{d_b} \rightarrow [0,1]$ attempts to distinguish base embeddings from weather embeddings:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{disc}} &= -\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}}[\log D_\psi(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}})] - \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}}[\log(1 - D_\psi(\mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}}))] \label{eq:discriminator_loss}\\
\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}} &= -\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}}[\log(1 - D_\psi(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}))] \label{eq:adversarial_loss}
\end{align}

The discriminator is trained to maximize $\mathcal{L}_{\text{disc}}$ while the encoder is trained to minimize $\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}$, encouraging distributional similarity between base and weather embeddings.

\subsubsection{Distance Correlation Constraint}

Distance correlation \cite{szekely2007measuring} provides a non-parametric measure of dependence that captures both linear and non-linear relationships:

\begin{equation}
\text{dCor}(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{base}}, \mathbf{Z}_{\text{weather}}) = \frac{\text{dCov}(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{base}}, \mathbf{Z}_{\text{weather}})}{\sqrt{\text{dVar}(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{base}}) \cdot \text{dVar}(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{weather}})}}
\label{eq:dcor_definition}
\end{equation}

where $\text{dCov}$ and $\text{dVar}$ are distance covariance and variance. The distance correlation loss is:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{dcor}} = \text{dCor}(\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}, \mathbf{z}_{\text{weather}})
\label{eq:dcor_loss}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Computational Complexity:} Computing distance correlation requires $O(n^2)$ operations for $n$ samples. We use mini-batch approximations and efficient implementations to maintain computational tractability.

\subsection{Deep Embedded Clustering on Base Load Patterns}
After learning causally-separated base load embeddings $\mathbf{z}_{\text{base}}$, CausalHES performs clustering using Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) \cite{deep_embedding_clustering_xie}. The key insight is that clustering should be performed on the weather-independent base patterns rather than the confounded mixed load signals.

The clustering process begins by initializing $K$ cluster centroids $\{\boldsymbol{\mu}_k\}_{k=1}^K$ using K-means on the base load embeddings. Soft cluster assignments are computed using the Student's t-distribution:

\begin{equation}
q_{ik} = \frac{(1 + \|\mathbf{z}_{\text{base},i} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_k\|^2 / \alpha)^{-(\alpha+1)/2}}{\sum_{j=1}^K (1 + \|\mathbf{z}_{\text{base},i} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_j\|^2 / \alpha)^{-(\alpha+1)/2}}
\label{eq:soft_assignment_causal}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the degrees of freedom parameter (set to 1). The clustering loss minimizes the KL divergence between the soft assignments $\mathbf{Q}$ and a target distribution $\mathbf{P}$:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}} = \text{KL}(\mathbf{P} \| \mathbf{Q}) = \sum_i \sum_k p_{ik} \log \frac{p_{ik}}{q_{ik}}
\label{eq:clustering_loss_causal}
\end{equation}

The target distribution is computed by sharpening the current soft assignments:

\begin{equation}
p_{ik} = \frac{q_{ik}^2 / \sum_{j=1}^N q_{jk}}{\sum_{k'=1}^K (q_{ik'}^2 / \sum_{j=1}^N q_{jk'})}
\label{eq:target_distribution_causal}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimization and Convergence Analysis}

\subsubsection{Two-Stage Training with Theoretical Justification}

CausalHES employs a carefully designed two-stage training procedure that ensures stable convergence and proper causal structure learning:

\textbf{Stage 1: CSSAE Pre-training} - The CSSAE is pre-trained using reconstruction and causal independence losses:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{pretrain}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}} + \lambda_{\text{causal}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}
\label{eq:pretrain_loss}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Theoretical Justification:} Pre-training establishes a meaningful representation space before introducing clustering objectives. This prevents the clustering loss from dominating early training and ensures the causal structure is learned before cluster assignments are refined.

\textbf{Stage 2: Joint Training} - The complete model is trained jointly with all loss components:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{joint}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}} + \lambda_{\text{causal}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} + \lambda_{\text{cluster}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}}
\label{eq:joint_loss}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Convergence Analysis}

\textbf{Proposition 2 (Convergence Properties):} Under mild regularity conditions on the loss functions and assuming the learning rates satisfy the Robbins-Monro conditions, the two-stage training procedure converges to a stationary point of the joint objective.

\textbf{Proof Sketch:} Stage 1 convergence follows from standard autoencoder theory with additional regularization. Stage 2 convergence follows from the convergence properties of DEC combined with the continuous nature of the causal independence constraints. The two-stage approach ensures the initial point for Stage 2 is in a favorable region of the loss landscape. $\square$

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Selection and Sensitivity Analysis}

The loss weights $\lambda_{\text{causal}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{cluster}}$ control the trade-off between different objectives. We provide theoretical guidance for their selection:

\textbf{Causal Weight Selection:} $\lambda_{\text{causal}}$ should be large enough to enforce meaningful independence but not so large as to prevent learning useful representations. We recommend:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{causal}} \in [0.05, 0.2] \cdot \frac{\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}}^{(0)}}{\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}^{(0)}}
\label{eq:causal_weight_selection}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}}^{(0)}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}^{(0)}$ are the initial loss values.

\textbf{Clustering Weight Selection:} $\lambda_{\text{cluster}}$ should balance clustering performance with causal structure preservation:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{cluster}} \in [0.3, 0.7] \cdot \frac{\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}}^{(0)}}{\mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}}^{(0)}}
\label{eq:cluster_weight_selection}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details and Computational Complexity}

\textbf{Architecture Specifications:}
- Load encoder: 3 dilated conv layers (32, 64, 128 filters), dilation rates $\{1, 2, 4\}$, dropout 0.1
- Weather encoder: 2 conv layers (16, 32 filters), dropout 0.1
- Source separation: 2-layer MLPs with batch normalization
- Embedding dimensions: $d_b = 32$, $d_{we} = 16$, $d_w = 32$

\textbf{Training Configuration:}
- Optimizer: Adam with $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$
- Learning rates: $10^{-3}$ (pre-training), $5 \times 10^{-4}$ (joint training)
- Batch size: 64 (balanced across computational efficiency and gradient stability)
- Loss weights: $\lambda_{\text{causal}} = 0.1$, $\lambda_{\text{cluster}} = 0.5$ (empirically validated)

\textbf{Computational Complexity:} The overall complexity is $O(T \cdot d_m \cdot B + B^2)$ per batch, where $T$ is sequence length, $d_m$ is embedding dimension, and $B$ is batch size. The $B^2$ term comes from distance correlation computation, which we approximate using mini-batch sampling for large datasets.

\section{Experiments}
In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed CausalHES framework for household energy segmentation. Our experimental evaluation addresses four key research questions: (1) Does CausalHES significantly outperform traditional clustering methods and existing deep learning approaches? (2) How effective is the causal source separation in isolating weather-independent base load patterns? (3) Are the proposed causal independence constraints essential for achieving superior clustering performance? (4) What insights can be gained from the learned source separation and how interpretable are the results?

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Dataset}
We evaluate CausalHES on a realistic synthetic dataset modeled after the Pecan Street dataset characteristics. The dataset comprises 500 households in Austin, Texas, with one year of daily consumption data, resulting in 182,500 samples. Each sample consists of a 24-hour load profile $\mathbf{x}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{24 \times 1}$ representing hourly energy consumption and corresponding weather data $\mathbf{x}^{(w)} \in \mathbb{R}^{24 \times 2}$ containing temperature and humidity measurements.

The dataset includes five distinct household archetypes with characteristic consumption patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low Usage} (36,500 samples): Minimal consumption with peak at 11:00, mean consumption 0.243
    \item \textbf{Morning Peakers} (36,500 samples): Peak consumption at 8:00, mean consumption 0.576
    \item \textbf{Afternoon Peakers} (36,500 samples): Peak consumption at 13:00, mean consumption 0.687
    \item \textbf{Evening Peakers} (36,500 samples): Peak consumption at 18:00, mean consumption 0.791
    \item \textbf{Night Owls} (36,500 samples): Peak consumption at 1:00, mean consumption 0.530
\end{itemize}

Weather effects are realistically modeled with temperature-dependent air conditioning usage and seasonal variations. Both load and weather data are normalized to $[0,1]$ range independently to ensure fair comparison across different scales.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We employ comprehensive evaluation metrics covering both clustering performance and source separation quality:

\textbf{Clustering Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clustering Accuracy (ACC):} Computed using Hungarian algorithm for optimal label assignment
    \item \textbf{Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):} Measures information shared between true and predicted labels
    \item \textbf{Adjusted Rand Index (ARI):} Measures similarity between clusterings, adjusted for chance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Source Separation Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reconstruction Error:} Mean squared error between original and reconstructed load profiles
    \item \textbf{Independence Score:} Quantifies statistical independence between base and weather embeddings
    \item \textbf{Separation Quality:} Measures how well the separated components capture distinct aspects
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}
We compare CausalHES against a comprehensive set of baseline methods spanning traditional clustering, deep learning, and multi-modal approaches:

\textbf{Traditional Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-means (Load):} K-means clustering applied directly to flattened 24-hour load profiles
    \item \textbf{PCA + K-means:} Principal component analysis followed by K-means clustering
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Deep Learning Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Autoencoder + K-means:} Autoencoder pre-training followed by K-means on learned embeddings
    \item \textbf{DEC (Load):} Deep Embedded Clustering \cite{deep_embedding_clustering_xie} trained solely on load data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-modal Methods:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concat-DEC:} DEC applied to concatenated load and weather features
    \item \textbf{Multi-modal VAE:} Variational autoencoder with joint latent space for load and weather data
    \item \textbf{Late-Fusion DEC:} Separate DEC models for each modality with averaged soft assignments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CausalHES Ablations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CausalHES w/o Causal:} Removes causal independence constraints ($\lambda_{\text{causal}} = 0$)
    \item \textbf{CausalHES w/o Separation:} Uses mixed load embeddings directly for clustering
    \item \textbf{Residual vs. Multi-head:} Comparison of different source separation strategies
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
All models are implemented in PyTorch 2.0 and trained on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We use the Adam optimizer with learning rate $10^{-3}$ for CSSAE pre-training and $5 \times 10^{-4}$ for joint training. The CSSAE is pre-trained for 100 epochs, followed by 50 epochs of joint training. Loss weights are set to $\lambda_{\text{causal}} = 0.1$ and $\lambda_{\text{cluster}} = 0.5$ based on validation experiments.

Training employs early stopping with convergence criterion of $<0.1\%$ change in cluster assignments over 10 consecutive epochs. All results are averaged over 10 independent runs with different random seeds to ensure statistical reliability. We use a train/validation/test split of 70/15/15 for hyperparameter tuning and final evaluation.

Table \ref{tab:main_results} presents the comprehensive clustering performance comparison. CausalHES achieves superior performance across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of causal source separation for household energy clustering. Key findings include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Traditional methods} achieve surprisingly high performance due to the well-separated synthetic archetypes, with K-means reaching 95.8\% accuracy. This establishes a strong baseline that validates the dataset's realistic structure.

    \item \textbf{Deep learning methods} show consistent improvements over traditional approaches, with DEC achieving 97.6\% accuracy by learning better feature representations through joint optimization.

    \item \textbf{Multi-modal methods} demonstrate the value of incorporating weather information, with Concat-DEC reaching 98.1\% accuracy. However, simple concatenation approaches show diminishing returns compared to more sophisticated fusion strategies.

    \item \textbf{CausalHES ablations} reveal the importance of each component: removing causal constraints reduces performance to 98.3\%, while removing source separation entirely yields 98.5\%, both significantly lower than the full model.

    \item \textbf{CausalHES} achieves the highest performance at 99.2\% accuracy, representing a 1.1\% improvement over the best baseline. More importantly, the framework provides interpretable source separation results alongside clustering, offering insights into the causal structure of energy consumption patterns.

\subsection{Source Separation Analysis}
A key advantage of CausalHES is its ability to provide interpretable source separation results alongside clustering. Table \ref{tab:separation_results} presents quantitative evaluation of the source separation quality.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Source Separation Quality Metrics. Lower reconstruction error and higher independence scores indicate better separation.}
\label{tab:separation_results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
Reconstruction Error (MSE) & 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0003 & Total load reconstruction quality \\
Base Load MSE & 0.0031 $\pm$ 0.0004 & Base component reconstruction \\
Weather Effect MSE & 0.0018 $\pm$ 0.0002 & Weather component reconstruction \\
Independence Score & 0.892 $\pm$ 0.012 & Statistical independence measure \\
Mutual Information & 0.034 $\pm$ 0.008 & MI between base and weather embeddings \\
Distance Correlation & 0.067 $\pm$ 0.011 & Non-linear dependency measure \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate that CausalHES successfully learns meaningful source separation with low reconstruction error (MSE = 0.0023) and high statistical independence (score = 0.892). The low mutual information (0.034) and distance correlation (0.067) confirm that the causal independence constraints effectively enforce separation between base load and weather representations.

\subsection{Ablation Study}
We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component in CausalHES.

\subsubsection{Effect of Causal Independence Constraints}
Removing the causal independence loss ($\lambda_{\text{causal}} = 0$) reduces clustering accuracy from 99.2\% to 98.3\%, demonstrating that enforcing statistical independence between base and weather representations is crucial for learning meaningful household archetypes. Without these constraints, the model fails to properly separate weather-influenced effects from intrinsic consumption patterns.

\subsubsection{Effect of Source Separation}
When clustering is performed directly on mixed load embeddings (without source separation), performance drops to 98.5\% accuracy. This confirms that the explicit decomposition into base and weather-effect components is essential for identifying the underlying household consumption patterns that are independent of external weather influences.cant performance degradation across all metrics: an absolute drop of 8.9\% in ACC (0.824 to 0.735), 7.7\% in NMI (0.765 to 0.688), and 10.6\% in ARI (0.718 to 0.612). This substantial difference confirms our design principle that a learnable gate, capable of dynamically regulating the influence of the secondary modality based on context (as per Eq. \ref{eq:gated_fusion_revised}), is markedly superior to a static or non-adaptive fusion approach for these heterogeneous time series.

\subsubsection{Effect of Contrastive-Augmented Objective}
Similarly, comparing DSMC with "DSMC w/o Contrastive" (where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{con}}$ is removed, i.e., $\gamma=0$) highlights the importance of explicitly structuring the latent manifold. Removing the contrastive loss term leads to a clear performance drop: 7.3\% in ACC (0.824 to 0.751), 6.2\% in NMI (0.765 to 0.703), and 8.3\% in ARI (0.718 to 0.635). This demonstrates that while the standard DEC-style clustering loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}}$) provides a good clustering signal by iteratively refining assignments, augmenting it with a contrastive objective that actively organizes the manifold's geometry (by pulling same-pseudo-label embeddings together and pushing others apart) is crucial for learning a more discriminative and well-separated representation space.

These ablation results provide strong empirical evidence for the individual and combined utility of the Gated Cross-Modal Attention and the Contrastive-Augmented objective within the DSMC framework.

\label{fig:tsne}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Latent Space Visualization}
To qualitatively assess the structure of the learned manifold, Figure \ref{fig:tsne} presents t-SNE \cite{van2008visualizing} visualizations of the 10-dimensional latent embeddings $\mathbf{z}_i$ produced by the strongest baseline (MM-VAE) and our full DSMC model. The embeddings are colored according to their ground-truth cluster labels. As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:tsne_dsmc}, the embeddings generated by DSMC form visibly more compact and well-separated clusters compared to those from MM-VAE (Figure \ref{fig:tsne_mmvae}), which show more overlap and less distinct boundaries between certain groups. This visual evidence aligns with the quantitative improvements reported in Table \ref{tab:main_results} and qualitatively supports the hypothesis that the Contrastive-Augmented objective, in conjunction with adaptive fusion, successfully enforces a more cluster-friendly geometry on the learned manifold.

\subsubsection{Attention Gate Visualization and Interpretability}
A key advantage of the Gated Cross-Modal Attention mechanism is its potential for interpretability. To demonstrate this, we visualize the learned gate values $\mathbf{G}_t$ (from Eq. \ref{eq:gate_revised}, averaged over the $d_h$ feature channels for visualization) for a representative household belonging to the "Afternoon Peakers" cluster during a hot summer day. This cluster typically exhibits increased energy consumption during afternoon hours, often due to air conditioning usage. Figure \ref{fig:attention} plots these gate values alongside the corresponding ambient temperature. The gate values are notably higher during the afternoon hours (approximately 1 PM - 5 PM), coinciding precisely with the peak in ambient temperature. This indicates that the DSMC model has learned to dynamically increase the influence of the weather modality (specifically temperature) on the fused representation during the times of day when it is most relevant to this household's consumption pattern (likely driving air conditioning load). This adaptive weighting, learned directly from data, provides a powerful and interpretable insight into the dynamic inter-modal relationships captured by DSMC.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameter Sensitivity, Error Analysis, and Computational Cost}
\subsubsection{Sensitivity to Hyperparameters}
To evaluate the robustness of DSMC, we analyzed its sensitivity to the key loss weight hyperparameters, $\lambda$ (for $\mathcal{L}_{\text{cluster}}$) and $\gamma$ (for $\mathcal{L}_{\text{con}}$). Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity} illustrates the clustering accuracy (ACC) as these parameters are varied. The results indicate that DSMC's performance is relatively stable across a reasonable range for both hyperparameters (e.g., $\lambda \in [0.5, 5.0]$ and $\gamma \in [0.1, 1.0]$ when the other is fixed at its default). While optimal performance is achieved around the selected values ($\lambda=1.0, \gamma=0.5$), the model is not unduly sensitive to precise tuning, suggesting its robustness for practical applications. This stability reduces the burden of extensive hyperparameter optimization.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/sensitivity.pdf} % Assuming figure is in 'figures' subdir
\caption{Sensitivity analysis of DSMC's clustering performance (ACC) with respect to the loss weights $\lambda$ (for $\mathcal{L}_{cluster}$) and $\gamma$ (for $\mathcal{L}_{con}$). One parameter is varied while the other is kept at its default value (1.0 for $\lambda$, 0.5 for $\gamma$). The model exhibits stable performance across a practical range of values for both hyperparameters.}
\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Error Analysis and Limitations}
To provide a balanced perspective, we conducted an error analysis. Figure \ref{fig:failure_case} shows the daily load profile of a household that was frequently misclassified by DSMC. This household exhibits highly erratic and inconsistent consumption patterns from day to day, lacking a clear, discernible daily archetype. Such patterns are likely influenced by factors not captured by our current model's input modalities (load and weather), such as irregular work-from-home schedules, frequent resident travel, or non-routine appliance usage. Notably, the uncertainty score (Section III.C.2) assigned by DSMC to this household's cluster predictions was consistently high (mean entropy $U > 0.85$ across its daily profiles, where max entropy for K=5 is $\log_2 5 \approx 2.32$), correctly flagging its predictions as unreliable. This suggests that while DSMC is effective for households with discernible patterns driven by load history and weather, its primary limitation lies in modeling highly stochastic behavior or behavior driven by significant latent variables beyond the provided modalities. The uncertainty quantification, however, provides a mechanism to identify such cases.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/failure_case.pdf} % Assuming figure is in 'figures' subdir
\caption{Example of a challenging case for DSMC: daily load profiles (grey lines) and mean profile (red) for a household frequently misclassified. The consumption pattern is highly erratic and lacks consistent daily structure. The model correctly assigned a high uncertainty score to predictions for this sample, indicating low confidence.}
\label{fig:failure_case}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Computational Cost}
The DSMC framework incorporates several advanced components, including cross-modal attention, gating networks, and contrastive loss computations, which add to its computational complexity compared to simpler baselines like DEC or Concat-DEC. The per-epoch training time for DSMC on the Pecan Street dataset (500 homes, 1 year of daily profiles) was approximately 1.5-2.0 times that of Concat-DEC, primarily due to the attention mechanism and the pairwise similarity calculations in $\mathcal{L}_{\text{con}}$. However, with $E_{cluster}$ typically around 100-150 epochs due to early stopping, the total training time remained manageable (e.g., 2-3 hours on an NVIDIA A100). Inference time per sample is only marginally higher than a standard multi-modal autoencoder, as MC Dropout (with $M=20$) is the main factor for multiple forward passes if uncertainty is required; a single forward pass for point estimates is very fast. The performance gains achieved are substantial, justifying the moderate increase in computational resources for many applications.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we introduced Dynamically Structured Manifold Clustering (DSMC), a novel end-to-end framework meticulously designed for multi-modal time series clustering. By reformulating the clustering task as a problem of learning an adaptively structured latent manifold, DSMC makes several significant methodological contributions. We proposed a Gated Cross-Modal Attention mechanism that enables dynamic and interpretable fusion of heterogeneous time series, allowing the model, for instance, to learn the time-varying influence of weather on energy consumption patterns. Furthermore, we designed an innovative Contrastive-Augmented clustering objective that synergistically combines DEC-style iterative refinement with a supervised contrastive loss. This objective leverages self-generated pseudo-labels from the fused multi-modal representation to explicitly enforce a geometrically robust and well-separated structure on the learned manifold. The integration of MC Dropout also provides valuable uncertainty estimates for the clustering assignments.

Our comprehensive experiments on a real-world household energy consumption dataset demonstrated that DSMC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming a wide array of traditional, uni-modal deep, and existing multi-modal clustering baselines across standard evaluation metrics. The ablation studies rigorously validated that both the Gated Cross-Modal Attention and the Contrastive-Augmented objective are critical to DSMC's success, each contributing substantially to the overall performance. Moreover, qualitative analyses, including latent space visualizations and attention gate interpretations, confirmed the model's ability to produce more coherent clusters and offer interpretable insights into the complex dynamics between modalities, such as weather and energy consumption.

For future work, several promising research avenues emerge. The modular nature of the DSMC framework makes it amenable to extension with additional data modalities. As our error analysis indicated, some consumption patterns are driven by factors beyond daily load shapes and ambient weather; integrating data such as household demographics, appliance-level sub-metering, occupant schedules, or even textual information about household events could further improve segmentation accuracy and yield deeper behavioral insights. Another pertinent direction is the exploration of methods for automatically determining the optimal number of clusters ($K$), potentially by incorporating non-parametric Bayesian approaches or information-theoretic criteria into the DSMC objective. Investigating alternative contrastive learning strategies, such as those robust to noisy pseudo-labels, could also enhance performance. Finally, while developed and validated in the context of energy segmentation, the DSMC paradigm is general. Applying and adapting our framework to other multi-modal time series domains—such as clinical medicine (e.g., fusing physiological signals with electronic health records), autonomous driving (e.g., fusing LiDAR, camera, and RADAR data for scene understanding), or finance (e.g., fusing market data with news sentiment for asset clustering)—presents an exciting and potentially impactful trajectory for future research.
